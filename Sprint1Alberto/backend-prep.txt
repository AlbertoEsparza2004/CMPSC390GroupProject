Sprint 1 prep (Ari)
Trello cards
 Check up on everyone
 Assist where needed
 Allow changes and submit project
 
 Setup steps
  Follow steps listed in Charles document so that I can work on with him 
 
 Development Plan
  I plan to work on the most on the backend, as the group decided this may end up being what requires the most time
  I will communicate with Charles every day, I plan to take on steps together so we can speed the progress up

Risks
 We may need the database schema, so I will check it to make sure it has everything we need, and get it to charles and myself
 Connecting backend to frontend will require communication between Charles and Alberto, I'll coordinate meeting times
 I need to ensure Charles and myself understand which sections we'd like to tackle, I will discuss in depth with him.
