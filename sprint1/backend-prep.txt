Setup steps
 Follow steps listed in Charles document so that I can work on with him (listed below)
 • Install Node.js
• Clone the GitHub repository
• Open the project folder in VS Code
• Run: npm init -y
• Install Express: npm install express
• Create server.js file
• Run server using: node server.js

Devlopment Plan
 I plan to work on the most on the backend, as the group decided this may end up being what requires the most time
 I will communicate with Charles every day, I plan to take on steps together so we can speed the progress up
 Steps listed below
 • Create backend folder and initialize project
• Install Express and required dependencies
• Create server.js file
• Add a test route (/test)
• Verify server runs without errors
• Document setup steps

Files to create:
• server.js
• package.json
• backend-prep.txt

Done means:
• Backend project initialized
• Server runs successfully
• Test route works
• Setup instructions are complete

Risks
 We may need the database schema, so I will check it to make sure it has everything we need, and get it to charles and myself
 Connecting backend to frontend will require communication between Charles and Alberto, I'll coordinate meeting times
 I need to ensure Charles and myself understand which sections we'd like to tackle, I will discuss in depth with him.
